<!--
	List of profiles available to be assigned to hosts.

	A profile represents a certain selection of packages from the package
	database. Profiles can depend on other profiles in order to build the
	complete set of packages to be assigned to a host.

	THIS IS A SAMPLE FILE.

	For detailed documentation on the XML structure, attributes etc it's
	recommended to have a look at the XSD schema included here:
		xsd/

	An automatically generated documentation of the XML structure is included
	here:
		documents/
	Just open documents/index.html in your favorite web browser.

	More documentation is available on the WPKG web-page as well:
		<http://wpkg.org/Category:Documentation>
