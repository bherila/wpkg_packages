This folder contains some sample package templates. They can be used to
kick-start your package repository.
For example if you just have to deploy an application packed with Nullsoft
Scriptalbe Installer System (NSIS) then just copy template_NSIS.xml to
/packages/some-software-name.xml and edit it to fill in values which match
your install repository structure and the application to be deployed.

Note: These templates might of course not cover any use-case and any application
but it might give some idea about how a package can be structured.

For more information about correct switches and many ready-to-be-used sample
packages visit <http://wpkg.org/Category:Silent_Installers>.
